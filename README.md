# PS3 Voice and Graphics Patch (in progress)

Currently hosting only the automated placed lines. All files need manual fixing, avoid placing them on your game.

README's going to be updated as the patch is developed. Refer to our [wiki](https://github.com/07th-mod/guide/wiki) for more details about the patch.

Old collaborators welcome to join the repository, however it's still preferred to fork the repository and update through pull requests.

# Scripts progress

>Bold lines means "in progress"

Nothing yet! This list will be updated when the game is actually out. :)

# Known issues (for fixing)

Thankfully, nothing yet. Would be bad if we had issues before the game is out.
